# email_server_distributed_systems
Creating clients, and servers that hold their emails, 
we do provide the port of the mail server of the receiver of the email,
as they all run on the local machine to make the communication possible.
One can observe the order of the actions in the following figure that define the succesfull reception
of an email sent by C1 reaching C2 after requesting to read his mails.
